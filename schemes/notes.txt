An implementation of three of the synthesized AE schemes, based on the optimized
OCB code of Ted Krovetz (http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/ocb/news/).  The
first scheme has a (simplified) Decode algorithm of:

      IN1 TBC INI1 XOR DUP OUT1 IN2 TBC XOR DUP OUT2 FIN1

the second scheme has a (simplified) Decode algorithm of:

      IN1 TBC DUP IN2 TBC XOR DUP INI1 XOR FIN1 OUT2 OUT1

and the third scheme has a (simplified) Decode algorithm of:

      INI1 IN1 XOR TBC DUP OUT1 IN2 XOR TBC DUP OUT2 FIN1

To run timing experiments of this scheme, modifying the MHz variable in run.sh
to the MHz of your processor and run "bash run.sh".
