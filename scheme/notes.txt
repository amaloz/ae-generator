An implementation of two of the synthesized AE schemes, based on the optimized
OCB code of Ted Krovetz (http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/ocb/news/).  The
first scheme has a (simplified) Decode algorithm of:

      MSG1 TBC INI1 XOR DUP OUT1 MSG2 TBC XOR DUP OUT2 FIN1

and the second scheme has a (simplified) Decode algorithm of:

       MSG1 TBC DUP MSG2 TBC XOR DUP INI1 XOR FIN1 OUT2 OUT1

To run timing experiments of this scheme, use NEW_1_SCHEME or NEW_2_SCHEME in
the call to run() in the main() function of timing_x96.c; to run timing
experiments of OCB, use OCB_SCHEME in the call to run().
